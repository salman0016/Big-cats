# Big Cats detection on Yolov5 using Jetson Nano 2gb

# Aim And Objectives

Aim :-

To create a Big Cats detection system which will detect cats face and mark. Then it will classify which species it belongs.

Objective :-

• The main objective of the project is to create a program which can be either run on Jetson nano or any pc with YOLOv5 installed and start detecting using the camera module on the device.

• Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

• To show on the optical viewfinder of the camera module whether a cat belongs to which species.

# Abstract
• A cat face is classified whether a cat is belonging to which species and is detected by the live feed from the system’s camera.

• We have completed this project on jetson nano which is a very small computational device.

• A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

• One such technique is to use YOLOv5 with Roboflow model, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.

• Because of human population growth and activity such as habitat removal and climate change, all big cat species populations are on decline. Conservation of big cats is needed to health of ecosystems as these are apex predators. 

• The purpose of this project is to observe big cats behaviour.

# Introduction
• This project is based on a Big Cats detection model with modifications. We are going to implement this project with Machine Learning and this project can be even run on jetson nano which we have done.

• This project can also be used to gather information about which species does the cats belong.

• Big cats can be classified into Tiger, Jaguar and Cheetah based on the image annotation we give in roboflow. 

• Cats detection sometimes become difficult as face or body are covered up by grass,tress and rock thereby making big cats detection difficult. However, training in Roboflow has allowed us to crop images and change the contrast of certain images to match the time of day for better recognition by the model.

• Neural networks and machine learning have been used for these tasks and have obtained good results.

• Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very useful in pattern recognition and classification, and hence can be used for Big Cats detection as well.

# Jetson Nano Compatibility
• The power of modern AI is now available for makers, learners, and embedded developers everywhere.

• NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts.

• Hence due to ease of process as well as reduced cost of implementation we have used Jetson nano for model detection and training.

• NVIDIA JetPack SDK is the most comprehensive solution for building end-to-end accelerated AI applications. All Jetson modules and developer kits are supported by JetPack SDK.

• In our model we have used JetPack version 4.6 which is the latest production release and supports all Jetson modules.
